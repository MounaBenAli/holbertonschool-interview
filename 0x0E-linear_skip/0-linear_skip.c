/**
 * linear_skip - searches for a value in a sorted skip list of integers
 *
 * @list:  Pointer to the head of the skip list to search in
 * @value: Value to search for
 *
 * Return: Pointer on the first node where value is located
 * if not located or if head in NULL return NULL
 *
 * Description: Skip Lists: A Probabilistic Alternative to Balanced Trees
 * It is a simple associative data structure.
 * That is, it maps keys to values, in very much the same way
 * as a hash table/dictionary/HashMap/map from other programming language.
 *  Requires only Î˜(logn) time in the average case for all operations.
